# Bike Sharing Ride Data
---
## Examining data from CitiBikes in New York City
---
### Purpose
---
#### This data analysis was a part of the UNC Chapel Hill Data Analytics Course, teaching Tableau as a data visualization tool. The data set was analyzed for Kate, who visited New York City and enjoyed the convenience of riding a bike around the city via a company called CitiBikes. The purpose behind this analysis was to analyze the CitiBike data in New York to apply it to Kate's hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. Kate wants to start a similar ride sharing experience in her hometown and has attracted investors interested in a business pitch with all the data. Since investors aren't interested in code, the data was presented through Tableau's features: data charts, dashboards, and stories. Here is a link to my Tableau Public profile, to see all the data visualizations created for Kate and for the analysis.

### Results and Visualizations
---
#### Average Trip Duration by Age
#### The above area chart outlines the average trip duration by age. Some of the older generation love to ride bikes for a relatively long time; however, when averaged between all the older generation birth years, overall, the average ride duration is small. The younger generation loves to ride bikes for an averagely long time.

#### Dashboard from Module 
# + fix by adding the end destination dot map
#### The above dashboard showcases many different visualizations from the module reading. The first bar chart in the upper left-hand corner outlines the peak riding hours in August. Around the morning commute and the afternoon commute are the peak riding hours for New York City in this August dataset. The next piece of the dashboard is a count of all the trips taken in August, 2.3 million rides. The next portion of the dashboard are the pie charts located in the upper right-hand corner. The first pie chart outlines how many riders are subscribers to the business and how many are single use bikers. Overall, there are 1.9 million annual subscribers. The bottom half of the visualization contains two dot plots of where riders start and end the most on a map of New York based on dot size and color. Overall, the start and end locations are relatively the same.

#### Checkout Times for Users
#### The above line graph outlines the checkout times for users. Overall, customers tend to checkout bikes for less than an hour. 
---
#### Checkout Times by Gender
#### The above line graph outlines the checkout times for users by gender. Overall, males tend to checkout bikes for rides more than females. 
---
#### Trips by Weekday per Hour
#### The above heatmap outlines when bikes are checked out per weekday and per hour. Overall, during commuting times and midday through the weekends are peak riding hours. 
---
#### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
#### The above heatmap outlines when bikes are checked out per weekday and per hour and also by gender. This chart outlines that males tend to checkout bikes more often than females, while both genders still prefer to ride during commuting hours and midday on the weekends. 
---
#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday
#### The above heatmap outlines what user types checkout bikes per gender and per weekday. Overall, the majority of annual subscribers are males that like riding through all days of the week. Females are mainly annual subscribers that checkout bikes during the week like males; however, there were less female riders in August when compared to male riders. The unknown gender column appear to be mainly one time customers.

### Summary
---
#### Out of the 2.3 million rides in August 2019, nearly 1.9 million were all subscriber based. The main subscribers to this ride share program are males according to the data. Peak hours for all riders, regardless of gender, tend to be morning commuting hours during the work week, afternoon commuting hours during the work week, and midday to afternoon on the weekends. Overall, the younger generation tend to rent bikes for longer periods of time making them the target audience. Another trend of this dataset is bikes tend to be picked up and dropped off the most near the same locations seemingly around the center of the city. 
#### Another interesting visualization idea for this dataset would be to compare how often bikes break down and how long it takes to fix them. It would be interesting to see if certain bikes break down due to longer ride times or possibly outside conditions like terrain type and weather. A second visualization idea for this dataset would be to look at how the bikes are being used possibly by looking further into the trip durations. Are customers only commuters and tourists or are companies renting these bikes for all day trips or delivering packages across the city. This idea could lead to finding out if bikes are needed more during tourist season or not.
